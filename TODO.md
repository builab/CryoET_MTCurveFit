- Do a basic rlnAnglePsi and rlnAngleRot for microtubule prediction (no template).
- Later on, need to check for polarity (does the 14PF template get right 13PF polarity)
- For cilia (9), perform a renumber rlnHelicalID (later) cilia_cluster_renumber (Make a core utils sort.py)
- Further more for angle prediction (for other filament), we can do median filter and then smoothing, option --smooth (NOT priority)
- There can be another kinds of prediction (--dphi and --dz) like the filament model in ChimeraX (later) (Determine polarity). Need to validate
- ChimeraX bundle (Does this worth the effort? Probably not)
- Test with data
