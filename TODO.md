- Do predict step & integrated into the workflow mtfit and mtfitchimerax
- Add proper angle prediction using '--template' for rlnAngleTilt/Rot/Psi (For cilia first)
- Further more for angle prediction (for other filament), we can do median filter and then smoothing, option --smooth
--There can be another kinds of prediction (--dphi and --dz) like the filament model in ChimeraX (later) (Determine polarity)
- For cilia (9), perform a renumber rlnHelicalID (later) cilia_cluster_renumber (Later)
- ChimeraX bundle (Does this worth the effort? Probably not)
- Test with data
