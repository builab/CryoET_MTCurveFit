- For cilia (9), perform a renumber rlnHelicalID (later) cilia_cluster_renumber (Make a core utils sort.py). If > 9 filament, don't do it.
- There can be another kinds of prediction (--dphi and --dz) like the filament model in ChimeraX (later) (Determine polarity). Need to validate
- ChimeraX bundle (Does this worth the effort? Probably not)
- Test with data

Less priorty
- Do a basic rlnAnglePsi and rlnAngleRot for microtubule prediction (no template).
- Later on, need to check for polarity (does the 14PF template get right 13PF polarity)
- For microtubule, perhaps a local smoothing (every 20 particles) is better
- Script to add rlnHelicalTubeID onto relion star file generated by Warp and even the rlnEven/Odd as well as sortID.

v0.9.2
 - Fix bugs to longer tubes
 - Fix fit.py, predict.py to output right rlnAngleTilt and rlnAnglePsi
 - Implement filter by psi in clean.py to remove horizontal tubes.
 
v0.9.3
 - Make visualize_star_angles.py to see the smoothness of angles to improve predict.py using outlier detection.
 - Implement smooth_angles for predict.py and work so well
 
v0.9.4
 - Finish combine_mtstar2relionwarp.py to combine the output file to a single star file used for Warp export
